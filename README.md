Project AEKI

My first project called AEKI. Created all by myself with Jquery for CodersLab final project. It's a website for fictional furniture store which consists of 4 subpages:
1. About - contains overall informations about store and encourages to visit the place.
2. Rooms - a slider being an online equivalent of interior design magazine to present newest collections of furniture. Consists of 5 different styles for: bedroom, bathroom, living room, kitchen and garden with different ideas for each style. Items for sale might be checked after clicking the plus signs.
3. Shop - Base for all the furniture on stock of the store. Items might be sorted by type of room, color, style, price, date and phrases included in name of furniture.
4. Get Inspired - last subpage using search engine's api for displaying it's results. The idea behind is to give the user inspirations for interior design by looking at the photo's.
